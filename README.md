Blathers is a barebone web app to view NFT collections for a specific wallet address or ENS domain. It's powered by [Zora](https://zora.co/).

## Setup

Clone repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/kislakiruben/blathers.git
```

```
cd blathers
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Rename `.env.example`

```
mv .env.example .env
```

Start the web app:

```
npm start
```

This will start a NodeJS server on `localhost:5001`.
